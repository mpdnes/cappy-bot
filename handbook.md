Policy Link: HR Administrative Policies | Human Resources | RIT

## Timekeeping Expectations

Time is recorded as it occurs. Employees should not be entering time once a day, week, or pay period.

Exact start/end times are recorded on your timecard.

For example:  If an employee is scheduled to begin work at 8:30 AM but actually begins at 8:29 AM, then the timecard must reflect 8:29 AM. Likewise, if they arrive at 8:31 AM, then the timecard must reflect 8:31 AM.

Meal periods are recorded correctly for your shift. Employees are not to work during meal periods. See Meal Break Requirements for more information.

All overtime is recorded. Employees should be informing their supervisors if they believe overtime is needed to complete a task. Supervisors should pre-approve overtime requests.

Please be sure to work to your scheduled lines. If they need to be changed, contact your Manager.

Any time worked outside of your scheduled lines must be pre-approved by your manager.

Please note that we reserve the right to remove your Kronos timecard access at any time.

If you miss a punch, notify your manager immediately.

## Timekeeping in Workday

The preferred method of timekeeping for the beginning and end of your shift is to check in using your RIT ID number at the Workday time clock closest to your desk.

At the end of each pay period, be sure that all of your time is entered correctly and that you have no missing punches.  Click the submit button.  This will send your timecard to your manager for approval.

Note: There is no need to hit the submit button prior to the end of the time period.

If you miss a punch, add it to and email your manager to let them know when and why a punch was added to your timecard.

# Dress  Code

Our department values professionalism and flexibility to accommodate the unique demands of working in a college setting. The attire of our staff should reflect respect for both our roles and clients while ensuring comfort and practicality for diverse work environments.  These guidelines will serve as our guiding principles for workplace attire for all RTC/NT employees.

## Dress Code Guidelines

Professionalism: Employees are expected to wear attire appropriate to their work setting, such as business casual for interviews or high visibility assignments.

Functionality: For physical or hands-on activities, such as gym classes or lab work, attire should prioritize for personal safety, mobility, and assignment suitability.

Versatility: Staff should be prepared to transition between roles by keeping a change of clothing available if necessary.  We also recognize that schedules do vary throughout the year, and attire expectations can be flexed as appropriate.

## Attire Parameters

Jeans are welcome! Choose dark wash or solid colors without rips, fraying, heavy fading, or distressing.

Pair jeans thoughtfully. Combine them with professional tops, shoes, and accessories for a neat, put-together style.

Skip overly casual combos. Athletic wear, hoodies, and T-shirts aren’t ideal for the office—except on RIT Swag Fridays, when sweatshirts, T-shirts, and hoodies are encouraged!

Footwear matters. Avoid worn athletic shoes. Choose clean, safe shoes appropriate for your work environment. Keep a pair of closed-toe shoes handy, as many labs require them.

Athletic gear stays at home. Sweatpants, sports shoes, and similar items aren’t suitable for work.

Lighter wash jeans tend to look more casual, so stick with darker tones for a professional vibe.

# Captionist Schedules

All captionist positions are assigned at 9 or 10 months, depending upon the position accepted upon hire. Work is not assigned during the months captionists are not scheduled to work.  9-month positions work annually from mid-August through mid-May and 10-month captionists work annually from mid-August through mid-May, with a 10th month scheduled sometime during the months of July or August.

## Scheduling

Class schedules are created twice a year, one for each semester and vary based on student requests.  Schedules are built by Scheduling Coordinators with the support of Team Leads using information from captionist preference sheets whenever possible, but are built around available class times which may vary from semester to semester. Students can adjust their schedules up until the end of Add/Drop week, so captionist schedules are not considered finalized until that period ends. Captionists are expected to be available at least two evenings (past 5 PM) per week to ensure adequate coverage for night classes.

You can view your work schedule through ASDS. For a more detailed description of ASDS, navigate to the ASDS section of the handbook.

## Captioning Assignment Types

The classes and assignments placed on your schedule may vary widely in their modes of instruction and formats. Outlined below are common class structures.

### Lectures

Lecture is the most common mode of instruction at RIT.  It is likely that most of your classes will fall under this category.  Every instructor handles class a little bit differently, so “lectures” can vary significantly in practice.  Some professors might lecture uninterrupted for the whole class, whereas others might allocate large chunks of time to group work, independent work, or discussion. Lectures are usually 50 minutes or 75 minutes in length.

### Labs

Many class sections have a lab component that corresponds with their lecture component, where students learn to apply the skills they have learned in lecture.  Because labs are often more hands-on, there is usually less overall time spent captioning in these assignments. Labs are usually multiple hours and can be shared among different captionists. Sometimes only the first hour of a lab is covered.

Be aware that since a course’s lecture and lab sections are disaggregated from one another, it is very likely that you will only be assigned to either the lecture or the lab section of a class, rather than both.  Also note that some labs function more like lectures; it all depends on the class and the professor.

### On-Calls

An on-call is a designated time during which you are expected to be available to caption any uncovered assignments. While on-call you must regularly monitor both your email and ASDS schedule for any updates or added assignments. The captioning coordinator will make every effort to provide advanced notice, but last-minute assignments can occur.

On-call slots may be added for a few reasons:

Class is canceled

A student is absent and notifies the captionist or RTCNT ahead of time

A student is absent or no-shows during the first hour of a multi-hour class

You permanently lose a class and there isn’t another ongoing assignment that fits your schedule at that time

#### One-Off On-Calls

These occur when a class is canceled or a student is absent on a specific day. You are placed on-call only for the duration of that class time on that day.

#### Ongoing On-Calls

These occur when you permanently lose a class and there is no immediate replacement available that fits within your schedule. You remain on-call during that time slot on a recurring basis until a new assignment is added to your schedule.

If you have an ongoing on-call you will be prioritized for a new class assignment over those with one-offs at the same time. This helps ensure fair scheduling and efficient use of coverage availability.

#### Exam Week On-Calls

During exam weeks captionists are considered on-call during the entirety of their working shift and must be able to cover assignments as needed.  All effort will be made by the scheduling coordinator to give notice but captionists must continue to monitor their email and schedule in ASDS

### Workshops/Recitations

Some of the classes we cover are more focused on hands-on group work or independent work.  If you are assigned one of these classes, it is important to ask the supported student(s) if they need captioning coverage in these settings.

### SRs (Special Requests)

Special Requests are assignments that require captioning outside of the traditional classroom structure.  These can include sorority meetings, student government, special interest housing meetings, clubs, orientations, summer programs, advisor meetings, training/professional development sessions, final exams, and so on.

After an SR is over, save your transcript for up to one month; however, SR transcripts are not uploaded to ASDS. If anyone requests a copy of the transcript, direct them to your manager. In practice, transcripts are not to be shared with anyone, but your manager may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis.

#### One-Off SRs

Many SRs are one-off assignments that only require captioning for a day or two, such as a guest speaker event or a job interview.  Final exams, presentations, and critiques that occur during Finals Week would also fall under this category.

#### Ongoing SRs

Some SRs are held on an ongoing basis, usually once per week.  For example, Student Government Senate Meetings might take place from 2 to 4 PM every Friday, running throughout the course of the entire semester, or Computer Science House General Meetings might meet every Sunday from 7 to 9 PM.

## Reading Day / Finals Weeks

After the last day of classes, captionists will be on-call for any special requests (SRs), final exams, or presentations students request coverage for.

## Break Weeks

When classes are not in session, captionists will work an 8 hour shift starting at either 8 AM or 9 AM. Before the end of each semester, a Request Time Off form (RTO) form will be sent out, and on this sheet you will indicate what start time you prefer.  SRs or final exams may be put on your schedule if there is need.

## Preference Sheets

Preference sheets will be sent out at the end of each semester to every captionist.  You will indicate your preferred start time, evenings/nights you are available to work, preferred colleges/classes to caption and teaming preferences. Preference sheets will be considered when creating schedules each semester. If you have any questions about preference sheets, reach out to your Team Lead for help.

## Overtime

After all classes have been assigned, any uncovered classes may be offered as overtime. More information will be given when these classes are offered. Overtime assignments may also be available on weekends, depending on what SRs or events are scheduled. These will be offered on an as needed basis each week they are available.  Weekend assignments are often for clubs, sororities or campus events.

Additionally, captionists may “volunteer” for certain campus events, such as Imagine RIT and commencement weekend, as overtime. To “volunteer” for these events, register through emails sent by RIT and notify your manager and RTCout of the hours and the shift you were assigned.

Overtime is in effect after 40 hours are reached during a Friday through Thursday pay period. For more information on RIT’s overtime and premium pay practices, visit the link below:

# ASDS     Guide

ASDS (Access Services Database System) can be found at: myaccess.rit.edu/ASDS.  ASDS is the Department of Access Services’ database that includes class information, course numbers, class rosters, student information, provider schedules, course transcripts, class notes, and internal notes for each assignment.

## Viewing Schedules

### Different Views

Schedule View

This view shows the week starting on a Monday.  It lists your shift lines and all assignments on your schedule.

Kronos Schedule View

This view reflects a Workday pay period schedule, so the week starts on a Friday. All other aspects of the schedule are the same as schedule view.

My Text Schedule

This view lists out shift information and classes in text only. This is useful if you need to view your schedule quickly on a mobile device or have slow internet connection.

### Shift Lines

Your schedule may feature various line colors, each representing a different meaning.  Refer to the descriptions below for an explanation of each color.

### Assignment Slots

Your schedule may include various types of assignment slots including classes, SRs, on-calls, and canceled classes.  Refer to the descriptions below for an explanation of each block color.

## Class Information Page

When you click on a class, you will be taken to a class information page.  There you will find information about the course name and number, related courses, room number, meeting times, professor, coordinators, captionists, interpreters, notetakers, students, internal notes, TypeWell channels, and change requests. Below is the main landing page. Each main section will be outlined in detail on the next pages.

### Course Overview

The course overview section will show the course number, name, term, session, dates, and all service provider coordinator information. This section also includes the Note icon, directing you to all transcripts.

### Meeting Pattern

The meeting pattern section will tell you the class days, start and end time, location, instructor name and email, and dates of the class term. Days indicate what days each week class takes place.  They are listed as MTWRF. You will typically see TR (Tue/Thu) and MWF (Mon/Wed/Fri) for classes.  Sometimes the class block in ASDS will list a slightly longer time than the actual class length, so check the start and end times here for the most accurate class duration. The location of the class is listed building number-room number.  If class is on Zoom, location will say ONLINE. The Zoom link will typically be listed under Slots. Date indicates the entire class term.

### Slots

The Slots section will show the current week’s class meeting schedule with class time, location, provider information (captionists, interpreters, notetakers), and the status of each service provider.

Looking at the example, you can learn the following information:

Class Time: Class goes from 10:00 AM to 11:50 AM

Location: Located online. The Zoom link is listed next to some provider’s names.  Copy and paste the URL into your web browser and you will be redirected to Zoom. If class was in person, it would be listed building number – room number.

Provider Info: There are two captionists, two interpreters, and one notetaker in this class.  The captionists are scheduled one per hour, first from 10-11 and the second from 11-12.

Status: “Covered in House” indicates a provider from RIT. Interpreters will sometimes have “freelance” indicating a provider from outside of RIT will be sent. In this example, the second hour captioning was not needed, so the status of the second provider says “Canceled with Charge”.

#### Future Slots

In addition to the weekly slot information, you are able to see future slots. To see upcoming slots check the box next to Show All Future located in the Slots section. This will bring up all future slots.

#### Past & Future Slots

You are also able to see future and past slots, with any notes also listed.  To view this information, use the following steps:

Go to the entire weekly schedule view in ASDS.

Click on the Slots icon located to the left of the Note icon, near to the course number.

From here, you will be redirected to the entire slot information.  (See below)

### Internal Notes

The Internal Notes section enables all service providers to view class-related notes. This section often contains notes about notetaking jobs, interpreter notes, and other operations notes. Notes are displayed in chronological order from oldest to newest.  All captionist notes should be added in the Captioning Data section only.

### Captioning Data

The Captioning Data section of ASDS allows captionists to share TypeWell channels, amount of iPads to bring to class, student need information, and other helpful information about the class.  At the beginning of every semester TypeWell channels for each class will be added under the Channel portion. After two weeks into the semester the rest of the information for each class will be entered.

#### Adding TypeWell Channels to ASDS

Click Edit and a pop-up box will appear

Enter the following information:

Channel: TypeWell channel or C4 link used for teaming or sharing classes.

iPads: The amount of iPads a captionist needs to bring to class.

Student Needs: Any helpful information about student needs such as group work needs, one-on-one needs, etc.

Other: Any other helpful information about the classroom or where the captionist usually sits.

Click Save and the information entered will appear in ASDS. Captioning Data is only visible to the captioning department.

### Student List

Below the Slots and Internal Notes section is the Student List. This shows all students enrolled in the class along with their email, major, class year, and any access requests. Directly under the heading for this section are two check boxes. Checking the box next to Hide Dropped Students will remove any student no longer enrolled in the course.  If you do not check this box, any dropped student’s name will be shown in red with a strikethrough, indicating they are no longer in the class.  Checking the next box, Hide Non-NTID, will remove all students not cross-registered at NTID from view.

Any students cross-registered at NTID will have an N icon to the left of their name. Just because a student has an N does not mean they are a captioning student.  They may be interpreting students, notetaking only students, etc. To see how many students use captioning, check under the Requests column. There will be a green check next to the word Caption for any student that was approved for captioning use. Any NTID student will always be at the top of the class list.

Note: Some classes are also cross-registered with other names or graduate levels. In these cases there are two class lists, a supported student could be in either list, so be sure you scroll to the bottom of a course list to check you have seen all captioning students.

Look in the examples below for a visual on what to expect.

In this example Hide Dropped Students is unchecked, showing all students that dropped in red with strikethrough across their name  There are two NTID students in the course.  Looking at the Requests column, you can see only one is a captioning student.  The other has no access requests.

In this next example, Hide Dropped Students is checked, so you only see students currently enrolled in class. There are 4 NTID students, two use captioning, one uses interpreting, and one has no requests.

If your supported student drops the class, the  captioning coordinator will notify you.  If you see that your supported student is listed as dropped but you haven’t been notified, email rtc fyi to inform them.

Note: Students are only able to have captioning or interpreting, not both.  However, they are allowed to have notetaking in addition to captioning/interpreting.

### Change Requests

When a student knows they are going to miss class, they can enter change requests through ASDS. When you scroll underneath the student list you can see any requests the student made. When the captioning coordinator acknowledges the request, the captionist will be informed that the student is not attending.

If the captioning coordinator has not yet seen the change request, it will not be acknowledged.  The captionist should notify rtc fyiif any changes occur before the captioning coordinator has acknowledged them.

# Talent Roadmap

Talent Roadmap serves as your online home for professional courses and tutorials. Talent Roadmap assists faculty and staff in reaching their professional development goals. Once you log in with your RIT credentials, you will see the Talent Roadmap dashboard.  From this page you can take a look at My Learning, which shows professional development (PD) courses you are currently enrolled in, your Plan Summary, which has a small diagram showing the PDs you have completed and those which you are currently enrolled in, and past PDs you have completed.

## Mandatory Trainings

There are required annual professional development courses you must complete each year.  “Annual completion of this course by all RIT employees is required by RIT’s Policy on Mandatory Training” (C25.0).  Email reminders will be sent annually by the institute to inform you of the upcoming due dates for these trainings.

See below for details on each.

Discrimination and Harassment (Including Title IX) for Current Employees.

All RIT policies related to sex and gender-based harassment and discrimination, including Title IX, can be found: rit.edu/fa/compliance/title-ix-policies.

Cybersecurity Fundamentals.

Individual Conflict of Interest and Commitment (ICIC) disclosure statement.

New employees must complete this via Talent Roadmap. Subsequent years will be completed on novelution via a link that is emailed out.

Diversity Education Module.

## Learning Catalog

RIT’s Talent Roadmap is connected with LinkedIn Learning and provides a wide variety of online professional development courses.  These are great resources to dive into during break weeks and during other down time during the semester.  You can search through the offered courses by using the Search Bar at the top right of the screen, or, by clicking Browse at the top of the Talent Roadmap dashboard, you will see something like this:

If you click on LinkedIn Learning here, you can browse through a variety of categories which offer professional development opportunities.  When deciding on one of these PDs, be sure to choose one that is pertinent to your role as a captionist.  During break weeks the specialists will often recommend helpful online PDs.   When you finish a LinkedIn Learning course, a completion receipt showing this will automatically be sent to your manager.

## External Learning

Many professional development opportunities are hosted in-house in our department.  When you attend one of these PDs, you can track it using Talent Roadmap.

Note: Activities offered in the department that are not an actual training or workshop related to improving your skills should NOT be added to the RIT Talent Roadmap Site. This includes games, scavenger hunts, coffee hours, department meetings, etc.

To manually add something to the Talent Roadmap dashboard, use the following steps:

Below the RIT banner, at the top left of the screen, click Me

From here your Plan page will be opened. Next to “My Plan”, click the dropdown arrow to the right of Actions.

# myCourses

myCourses is RIT's Learning Management System (LMS). It uses the Brightspace by D2L platform, but is branded as myCourses. Instructors create course materials, deliver the content, and monitor and assess student performance with assignments, quizzes, grades, etc. Students have a central repository of course information, assignments, and expectations to allow for easy access and planning for time management. myCourses can be used in fully online, hybrid/bended, and fully in person courses. (RIT)

myCourses can be accessed at: mycourses.rit.edu

myCourses allows captionists to view course materials such as syllabi, homework, lecture material, and other content that can be used to prep for assignments. If professors do not post lecture material before class, you can reach out to them to see if they will provide you material before they post it.

## Shells

myCourses arranges each class you are assigned to into “shells.”  Shells are listed as blocks with the course information. Shells are separated by each semester and the example below is for the spring 2024 semester.

When you click on a specific shell, you will be able to view all of the course material currently available for that class, provided that the professor uses myCourses.  As seen above, the shells are organized into semesters so you can access classes you were previously enrolled in.  It’s important to note that while captionists are usually allowed access to these shells from the start of the semester, occasionally you may have to contact the professor and ask them to add you manually.

Note: Sometimes there are multiple sections of a course, or a lab and lecture section, and the professor only updates one section’s shell.  If you see zero content in the course shell after the first 2 weeks of class, reach out to the professor and see if this is the case.

## Captionist Skill Building & Resources

In addition to using myCourses to access course material, there is a shell entitled Captionist Skill Building & Resources that all captionists are automatically enrolled in.  This shell has a wealth of great information for all things captioning.  From skill building to general department information, this shell is a valuable resource and will continually be referred to throughout the handbook.

# Slack

Slack is a communication platform that allows for real-time messaging, content sharing, and collaboration between team members.  All RIT students, faculty, and staff members are able to join RIT community workspaces in RIT’s Enterprise Slack Server.

## Getting Started

### Download & Access Slack

Slack can be downloaded at slack.com/downloads/windows.  Alternatively, you can use Slack via your web browser, but using the dedicated application is recommended.  Once you’ve installed the program, sign up with your RIT email address so that you have access to RIT’s enterprise server. You will need to use DuoMobile when first setting up your RIT account.

## Workspaces

RIT uses multiple Slack workspaces to organize communication across departments. Each workspace is like its own Slack environment with separate channels, messages, and members. You should have access to both NTID Department of Access Services and Real-Time Captioning and Notetaking workspaces. If you are not part of this workspace, reach out to your Team Lead for further assistance.

You can view all workspaces together by selecting, All workspaces from the dropdown menu on the top-left corner (near the RIT logo), or choose to see just one workspace by selecting it individually in the same dropdown menu.

## Channels

Channels help keep communication organized by topic, so it’s easier to find relevant information and follow discussions. This prevents one long string of messages that are hard to keep up with. If there is a channel you don’t want to follow closely, you can mute it by right-clicking the channel name and selecting mute channel. You will still have access to it, but you won’t receive any notifications when messages are posted and the channel title will appear grayed out.

### Organizing Channels

If you choose to view all workspaces at once, all the channels you’re part of across those workspaces will be mixed together under Channels. By default channels are usually shown in alphabetical order.

To keep things organized, you can create custom sections in your sidebar and group channels however you like. For example, you can create sections for DAS and RTCNT channels. Within each section, channels will remain in alphabetical order.

Ways to create and move channels into sections:

Option 1: From Channels menu

Click Channels in the sidebar

Hover over Create → select Create section

Name section → click Create

Drag and drop channels into the new section

Option 2: Right-click on specific channel

Right click on the channel name you want to organize

Hover over Move channel

Choose either:

Move to a new section to create and name a new one on the spot or an existing section to move into

### RTCNT Channel Guide

In the RTCNT Slack workspace there are five channels used. See below for more details on each one.

#### #rtc-c4support

This channel is for all things C4 including questions, troubleshooting, and C4 specific tech support.

#### #rtc-fun

This channel is a space for community, connection, and non-work related talk– events, recommendations, and things happening in and around RIT.

#### #rtc-general-work

This channel is the main channel for RTCNT announcements, team-wide info, and all work-related discussions or questions. Anything work related and not specific to PDs, C4, or tech-support should be brought to this channel.

#### #rtc-professional-development

This channel is for PD announcements, ideas, and questions. Here you will find a folder PD Materials with links to PD materials in the RTCNT Google Drive and a quick link to the captionist myCourses shell.

#### #rtc-tech-support

This channel is for tech questions and support about anything from Slack, TypeWell, Zoom, computer issues, etc. Any general tech questions can be brought here.

### DAS Channel Guide

The DAS (NTID Department of Access Services) Slack workspace is for communication across all of DAS, not just the RTCNT department. In this workspace there are two channels used: #das-all-general-fun and #das-all-general-work. Any work related messages go in the channel #das-all-general-work and anything else goes in #das-all-general-fun.

### Channel Tabs

At the top of each Slack channel you’ll see a row of tabs, these are called channel tabs or the channel header. They help you quickly access different types of content shared within the channel. The tabs you see may vary depending on what has been shared, and not every channel uses every tab.

The most common tabs in our workspace include:

Messages - The main chat for conversations.

Pins - Important messages that have been pinned for quick reference.

Files - A collection of all files uploaded or shared in the channel.

Folders - Collection of related content saved in one space for quick reference. All documents found in folders can also be found in the RTCNT Google Drive.

More help with Slack channels can be found here: Using Slack Channels.

## Threads

Threads help keep conversations organized by grouping replies under a specific message. This makes it easier to follow discussions without cluttering the main message feed. Replies to that post will only be visible if you open the thread. To see Slack’s guide to threads visit: Use threads to organize discussions | Slack

### Reading Threads

Under the original post, you will see icons of who has replied along with the number of replies and the time of the last post.

This appears as a small line of text like 2 replies Last reply 1 hour ago.

To see all replies in the thread click on the blue replies counter, next to these icons. The thread will open on the right side of your Slack window, allowing you to scroll through the entire thread.

### Replying in a Thread

From the original post in the channel:

Hover over the message you’d like to reply to

Click the

A panel will open on the right side of your screen

Type your reply in the box and press Enter to post in the thread

If you'd like to send your reply back to the channel or DM's main view, check the box below your message.

## Emojis & Reactions

Emojis are a quick, visual way to respond to messages or add tone to your communication. You can use them in your own messages or as reactions to someone else’s message.

To add emojis to your messages you can click the smiley face icon in the message field to open the emoji menu. You can scroll through available emojis or use the search bar to find a specific one. You can also type the emoji code using colons around the emoji name (e.g., :astonished: turns into 😲)

Emoji reactions allow you to respond without typing a full message, for example using 👍to show agreement. To add a reaction you can hover over the message you want to react to and choose a preset reaction or click the emoji with plus icon and find another reaction.

## Direct Messages (DMs)

Direct messages (DMs) are smaller conversations in Slack that happen outside of channels. DMs work well for one-off conversations that don’t require an entire channel of people to weigh in, like if you wanted to ask a coworker to reschedule a meeting. DMs can be one-to-one, or they can include up to nine people.

Each DM conversation is saved and can be accessed later under the DMs tab on the left toolbar as well as the Direct messages section in the left toolbar. You can also “DM yourself”, which functions as a dedicated space where you can draft messages, make to-do lists, store important links and files, etc.

There are a few ways to create DMs including:

Hover over Direct messages in the sidebar to the left and click the + button.

Use the shortcut Ctrl + N.

Click the pencil and paper icon that says New message

Use search bar at the top to find the person (or people) you want to message

## Status

As you work in Slack, it's helpful to let your team know how quickly you can respond to messages and when you're available. Slack has a couple of ways to share your whereabouts and indicate your availability to other members. A status is a message that lets others know what you’re up to. Availability refers to the dot next to your display name that indicates if you’re active in Slack. For a guide on how to set statuses see: Set your Slack status and availability

The most commonly seen statuses and availability are:

🔘 Away (outline of a circle)

Appears automatically when not on Slack, not logged in, inactive for a certain amount of time. You can also set your status manually as Away.

Active (solid circle, color can vary based on your theme preferences)

Appears usually automatically when logged in and online.

Paused Notifications or DND

Can appear automatically if you have a time range set, or set manually for a specific amount of time. You will not get any Slack notifications when this status is set.

📅 In a meeting

To enable this status you must first install Outlook Calendar app for Slack, more info can be found here. Once enabled, Slack automatically syncs with your Outlook calendar events and sets your status to In a meeting when you have an event scheduled.

## Slack vs. Email

Slack is better suited for informal communication and conversations that might otherwise clutter email inboxes.  It also allows our department to have searchable, collaborative discussions that are easy to refer back to later.

While Slack is a useful tool, there are times when email is more appropriate to use. See the table below for examples of when to use each.

# OBS    Software

OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free, open-source application that allows you to record video and audio from your laptop.  This is the software you will use to record work samples as part of our career ladder process.

To view a guide with screenshots, please refer to: OBS Guide

## Getting Started

Navigate to the following address to download the Windows release of OBS Studio: obsproject.com

Once OBS is installed, to find where your video files will be recorded, go to:

File → Settings → Output → Recording Path

You can click the Browse button, to the right, to change this location.  You can also change the recording format, quality/file size, and video encoder.  It is okay to leave these values at their default settings. Recommended formats are .mkv or .mp4.  For the video encoder, using Hardware (QSV, H.264) should improve performance by reducing the load on your laptop’s CPU.

## Audio Settings

Before you record, ensure that your desired microphone is selected under:

File → Settings → Audio → Mic/Auxiliary Audio

Choose the dropdown to the right of Mic/Auxiliary Audio to select what microphone you would like to use, then click OK.

If your microphone is working properly, you should see activity in the Mic/Aux section of the Audio Mixer in the main OBS window.  You can adjust volume levels using the corresponding slider.

## Video Settings

Before you begin recording, you will first need to add a scene.  Follow the steps below.

Make sure that your TypeWell software is open.

Click the + icon under Scenes (in the very bottom-left of the OBS window) and give the new scene a name.

With your new scene selected, click the + icon (on the bottom-left of the Sources window)

Choose Window Capture, and give the new source a name (such as “TypeWell”).  Click OK.

A new screen will appear.  Under the dropdown menu next to Window, choose the one beginning with [TWTranscriber.exe] and click OK.

You should now see a preview of what your recording will look like towards the top of the main OBS screen (otherwise, click Enable Preview).

You can adjust the position of your TypeWell source in the preview by clicking anywhere inside your TypeWell source and dragging.

If your TypeWell source is too small or too big, you can stretch the window by clicking and dragging the red boxes along the perimeter of the window.

## Recording

Once you are satisfied with the way your TypeWell source appears in the preview, and after ensuring your microphone is enabled and functioning properly, you can record by clicking the Start Recording button under Controls towards the bottom-right of the main OBS screen.

A red dot will appear at the bottom of the screen, along with a timer to indicate how long the recording has been going on.

Once you are done with your recording, click the Stop Recording button.

Your file will now be saved in the location given in File → Settings → Output → Recording Path.

If you did not manually change this location, it is likely C:\Users\[yourusername]\Videos.

Open the file to ensure that the visuals and audio are as desired.

Refer to Work Sample Submissions for details on where to upload these work samples.

# RIT           Zoom

Zoom is RIT’s video conferencing solution. You can synchronously connect with anyone else across the globe using your device's camera and microphone. Instructors can increase interaction and participation using features such as polls, breakout rooms, whiteboard, screen share, and chat. Zoom meetings can be recorded and played back via the browser. Recordings are automatically captioned and captions can be edited. (RIT)

Occasionally you may have to cover an assignment that is on Zoom.  To ensure you have the best possible access to any online assignment you may be required to cover, Zoom should be installed on your computer.

## Download & Sign in to Zoom

Occasionally you may have to cover an assignment that is on Zoom.  To ensure you have the best possible access to any online assignment you may be required to cover, Zoom should be installed on your computer. To download, follow the instructions below:

Go to rit.zoom.us

Select Download Client

Choose Download 64 bit

Open the download from top right corner and follow instructions

Sign into Zoom using your RIT credentials, or by clicking sign in with SSO and typing in “rit”.  Once you’re logged in, you can then join/host meetings and configure your settings.

## Join a Session

To join a session, you must have the 9 digit meeting ID and password if necessary.  This meeting ID/password can usually be found in the myCourses section of the assignment in question, or listed in the internal notes/location on ASDS.  Sometimes the professor/host of the meeting may need to be contacted in order to obtain the Zoom link.

While it is possible to caption directly in Zoom using TypeWell Everywhere, it is recommended to simply caption in the regular channel you use for the assignment and class, and the supported students will use the URL provided for the channel you’re using.  Once you are in the correct meeting, you can caption the assignment as you normally would.

To view an older guide with screenshots, please refer to: Zoom Handbook

The Zoom Handbook guide listed above contains a lot of information about using TypeWell Everywhere to caption directly in Zoom.  You can disregard these parts if you have opted to caption in TypeWell for a remote assignment.  The guide still contains useful information regarding logging in, Zoom settings, and more.

# Laptops

RTCNT Captionists are granted exempt status from NTID TIS security control. Having exempt status is a privilege. Upon hire, captionists sign the NTID Administrative Agreement accepting full responsibility for any and all equipment in their possession. This agreement allows captionists to visit non-secure websites, as well as the freedom to download approved files or programs directly to a laptop.

By signing this agreement, you accepted personal responsibility for all equipment in your possession. This exempt status requires that all laptops and equipment in your possession be used for work purposes only, and further, that downloads or access to websites for personal use are prohibited (Facebook, banking, personal emails and downloads, pictures, etc.).

Failure to comply with this agreement can and will lead to loss of administrative rights, as well as disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. Therefore adherence to these guidelines is an expectation of employment.

Refer to the Workstation Administration Rights Agreement for more details.

## Laptop Use

### Guidelines

Laptops are for captioning and work-related use only

Never open questionable emails on your laptop, report these to RIT "Phish Bowl"

Do not access, store, or transmit (upload/download) private/personal information on your laptop, including pictures

Never download a program without prior approval

Do not change or modify the settings of the laptop unless prompted to do so by NTID TIS or RIT ITS

Never leave laptops unattended

Turn laptop off at the end of each day

Run Ivanti security scans when prompted to do so from NTID TIS emails, following the procedure listed in the email

Contact RTC Administrative Coordinator with any laptop issues- a spare laptop can be assigned to you in the event of urgent computer issues

Any infractions will be reported and may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment

Always put your laptop in sleep mode before closing the lid

### Best Practices

Back up your PAL and TypeWell linking channels on a weekly basis, or at least at the end of each semester. This helps in the case of needing a loaner laptop as you will be able to quickly utilize your PALs.

Export these files to your desktop and save them to your Google drive or N drive and email a copy to yourself.

Instructions on exporting PALs can be found under TypeWell information.

When traveling to and from captioning assignments, keep your laptop in a padded case. Equipment should never be hanging out of a bag. If it does not fit in a backpack, you must use a wheeled computer bag.

Run security updates ASAP when directed to do so by NTID Technical Support. An email will be sent out no less than once per month directing you to perform these updates.

Sleep should be set to never when on battery power.  You do not want your computer to accidentally go to sleep while in an assignment.

Turn your computer off at the end of each day.

Be sure to keep your power cord in your laptop bag with you on all assignments.

## Backing-Up Laptop

On occasion you may be assigned a new laptop, requiring you to turn in your current laptop. In these scenarios it is helpful to back-up your old computer to easily access your files on your new one. See the list below for what to back-up.

## eduroam (RIT)

RIT’s primary Wi-Fi network is eduroam (RIT). Eduroam is a global wireless network access service for research and education. Once you're set up, you can connect to wireless networks at other participating institutions with your RIT credentials.

To connect, simply go to rit.edu/wifi and follow the prompts there. You don't need to be on campus, but will need to be connected to the internet in order to set it up.  Detailed steps can be found here.

## DuoMobile - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-factor authentication turns your login into a two-step process that uses your login information and a code to allow you access to applications and web sites that store sensitive data.  Because a successful login requires both a correct password and an additional verification, it makes it much harder for an attacker to use a lost or stolen password to access your account.

Multi-factor authentication is a way of ensuring that only you are able to access your accounts in these applications. In addition to your username and password, multi-factor requires you to provide an additional verification step to prove it is really you accessing your account. RIT uses Duo to provide MFA.

More information about MFA can be found here.

### What to do if you Forget Your Phone or the Battery Dies

If you have set up bypass/offline codes in advance, you can use those to log in if your phone is unavailable.  If you have not already set up bypass codes and your phone is unavailable, please visit the RIT Service Center in person, and we can issue you bypass codes that will allow you to use MFA until you have access to your phone again.

Instructions for creating bypass/offline codes can be found here.

If you need assistance or have a question related to your Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), please reach out to the RIT Service Center.

## Helpful Keyboard Shortcuts

# Google           Drive

## Personal RIT Google Drive

All employees have access to their own RIT Google Drive through the RIT Google Suite. This account provides access to tools such as Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, etc. for creating, editing and storing work-related documents. While most Google Suite tools are available, RTCNT employees do not have access to Gmail through their RIT account.

Your Google Drive can be used as a backup for your PALs, notes, or other important documents. It is also used to share work samples with your manager as part of the career ladder promotion process. Since RIT faculty and students also use the Google Suite, you may use Google Drive to access or share class-related materials as needed.

### Activate Your Account (New Hires)

Before you can access your RIT Google Drive, you must first activate your account:

Visit start.rit.edu/GoogleApps (case-sensitive)

Click Opt In button

Once activated you will have full access to your RIT Google Suite (excluding Gmail).

## iPad Information

iPads are assigned to each captionist for the semester, usually 2 per captionist. It is the captionist’s responsibility to maintain this iPad and keep it charged and clean. If you need help or have questions about iPads, contact a Specialist. If you lose or misplace an iPad, contact your manager as soon as possible.

### Passcodes

### Extra iPads

If you need more iPads for an assignment, extra are available in the corner desk of 1260. You can check these out and then return them each time you need extra for a class, or talk to a Specialist about checking out extra iPads for the semester. Follow the equipment management procedure when checking out and returning iPads.

You can also find extra chargers and dongles for connecting iPads when projecting captions.

To check out an extra iPad use asset checkout system in 1260. See a specialist for help.

### Return Equipment

Fully charged iPads can be powered off and set in appropriately marked section of the desk.  If there are no charging cords available, leave a note on top of iPad indicating it still needs to be charged.

When sharing iPads with other captionists, you may return their iPad to 1260.  Use a note to indicate who the iPad belongs to, and make sure to charge it.  If you are returning multiple iPads, stack them in a pile and indicate on your note how many there are and for whom. Make sure you coordinate when returning iPads, you may choose to drop them off in someone’s office instead of 1260.

### iPad Basics

Power On: Hold down the power button until the Apple logo appears in the center of the screen. The logo remains there while the device boots up. A message will appear saying “Press Home to Unlock” when it is done booting. Press the Home Button and enter the passcode: 1997 (old iPads) or 19971997 (new iPads). The home screen will then appear.

To open a browser, tap the Safari Icon. There you can type in the URL for your TypeWell channel.

To return to the home screen from any program, touch the home button or swipe upwards from the bottom of the screen.

Sleep: Press the power button once to sleep the iPad. Do NOT just close the case - the iPad can sometimes stay on and drain the battery.

Power Off: For old iPads, hold down the power button until a message appears saying “Slide to Power Off”. For new iPads, hold down the power button and either of the two volume buttons. Drag the slider bar across and the device will shut down in a few seconds. Keep the cover open until you know it has fully shut down.

Battery: The iPads hold a charge much longer than a traditional laptop. A battery symbol with the percent of battery life remaining appears on the screen in the upper righthand corner. Please make sure to recharge them regularly. The battery cord plugs into the edge of the device just under the home button.

Other: The screen orientation will rotate as you turn the device if Rotation Lock is off. To toggle Rotation Lock, swipe down from the top right corner to open the Control Center and look for the Rotation Lock button.

#### iPad Error Message

You may encounter an error message that reads: Your apple ID is now being used for iMessage and facetime on a new iPad.  If you see this message, don’t panic.  If time allows, record the iPad numbers displayed and report them to the RTC administrative coordinator.  They will identify these iPads and correct the settings on them.

If you do not have time, hit OK. You may have to hit OK a few times as it will list every individual iPad where the settings need to be updated, but it will eventually clear this error out. Give yourself some time to do this before going to class.

You may also encounter a different pop-up message that reads: Apple ID Verification. It asks you to sign back into the iCloud account. Please do so using the password listed above. If you ignore the request, it will continue to pop up frequently until correct login information is entered.

# TypeWell           Software

TypeWell is a system for capturing spoken content and generating an immediate meaning-for-meaning transcript.  Using our advanced abbreviation software, a trained TypeWell transcriber synthesizes the essence of the discussion in clear English text. This form of communication access is commonly used by individuals with hearing loss or who need additional support. (TypeWell)

## Things to Know

DO NOT PRESS FILE → NEW if you are teaming a class and still connected to the link, as this will clear the transcript for all readers

At the bottom left of the screen, you can find the shortest abbreviation for the word you just typed

If something feels off, or if your abbreviations suddenly aren’t working as you expect, check to see if you accidentally disabled Turbo mode or switched to a different PAL profile.  This can happen if you accidentally press the F1, F3, F5 keys, etc. You might have also pressed Ctrl + E, which disables all abbreviation expansion

If TypeWell crashes and you haven't yet saved your transcript, don’t panic.  Everything you typed will usually remain in the transcriber window after re-opening TypeWell

Favor More Common Words is an option that can be toggled on and off.  There are pros and cons to both settings.  We recommend choosing one and sticking with it

Adding custom speaker identifiers to your PAL can be very useful during group work, presentations, or classes taught by multiple professors

You can navigate backwards, highlighting one word at a time, by pressing Shift + Semicolon. You can then use the Semicolon key as normal to highlight a sequence of multiple words

Shift + Space will capitalize the word you have highlighted, or uncapitalize if it is already capitalized.  If you highlight multiple words and press Shift + Space, this follows titling conventions, so words like “of” and “the” will remain uncapitalized, e.g. taming of the shrew {Shift + Space} → Taming of the Shrew

Two slashes // before any word or string of letters will capitalize the entire word.

//usa → USA

Press Tab to navigate forward when highlighting (otherwise, Tab will indent)

If you want to unexpand what you just typed, you can press Ctrl + Comma

Pressing Ctrl + T will generate a graph showing your abbreviation performance statistics (if you accidentally press this mid-class, TypeWell may feel sluggish for a moment)

Pressing Ctrl + Caps Lock will turn on Caps Lock.

Ctrl + L creates superscripts (think “L” for low). To go back to regular hit Ctrl + L again, Ctrl + N, or double space.

Ctrl + H creates superscripts with (think “H” for high). To go back to regular hit Ctrl + H again, Ctrl + N, or double space.

Ctrl + N goes back to normal (think “N” for normal).

Ctrl + I turns on italics. To turn off italics you can press Ctrl + I again or Ctrl + N

Ctrl + A open your PAL

## Hot Keys

See below for more keyboard shortcuts in TypeWell.

## PALs (Personal Abbreviation Lists)

Custom abbreviations can be added to your PAL by pressing Ctrl + A to open up the PAL window followed by Ctrl + N, or click the New Abbreviation button in the bottom-left corner of the PAL window. After typing your desired abbreviation, TypeWell will display what it currently expands to, if anything.  You then type your desired expansion in the “New expansion” box and hit Enter, or click the OK button.

On-the-fly abbreviations can be made directly from the main TypeWell window.  Type the word or phrase that you want to abbreviate, then highlight the word(s) using the semicolon key, press Ctrl + A, type your desired abbreviation, and hit enter.

Math mode has its own separate PAL.  You can access the math mode PAL window by entering math mode with the Caps Lock key and then pressing Ctrl + A, or by pressing Caps Lock with your normal PAL window open.

When outside of math mode, you can still access your math mode abbreviations as well as TypeWell’s built-in math mode symbols by typing the abbreviation and pressing Ctrl + Space instead of Space.

PALs are sorted into tabs that can help keep your abbreviations organized. For example, you can house all of your computer science abbreviations in a single tab, house all of your medical terminology in a different tab, and so on.  Tabs can be enabled and disabled in situations where you only want a set of abbreviations to be active for a specific assignment and inactive elsewhere.

You can also use tabs to set the comma cycle order of duplicate PAL entries, where precedence follows from left to right.  You can adjust the position of tabs by clicking and dragging them in the PAL window.

PAL profiles (F4 through F12) offer an even more granular level of organization.  For each profile, you can choose which particular PAL tabs you wish to be active or inactive.  Setting up profiles in advance can save you the trouble of having to repeatedly enable and disable the same tabs for specific assignments.

Built-In Shortcuts

## Turbo Mode

TypeWell Turbo is a mode that contains advanced abbreviation patterns, designed to help TypeWell transcribers significantly reduce their keystrokes and thereby increase the amount of information they can capture.

Every captionist is expected to learn and use TypeWell Turbo mode.  Mastering TypeWell Turbo mode is an important part of our role as service providers and helps us provide the best possible communication access for our students.

Turbo mode can be enabled by hitting F2 on your keyboard, or by clicking the Turbo →Turbo mode (F2). When Turbo mode is engaged it will say Turbo mode (ON).

Note: If Turbo mode is off, it will say nothing to the right of it. Whatever mode is currently engaged will have (ON) to the right of it instead. E.g. Classic mode (ON) or eXtreme mode (ON)

To get a complete list of all the Turbo courselet has to offer, click Help → Math and Turbo Help.  For additional practice resources and other helpful information about Turbo mode, go to the Captionist Skill Building & Resources shell in myCourses and find the Skill Building section.  There you can find a multitude of practice drills and other helpful resources to further your TypeWell Turbo skills.

Additional Turbo features were added over time, including unique speaker IDs (/k for Speaker:, for example), “proper word” patterns (/mo for Monday, /jan for January, /nyc for New York City), and a large list of transcriber comments, such as /ch for [Can’t hear/Can’t understand.]  The full list of these features can be found here.

See below for a quick guide to Turbo abbreviations.

### Turbo Prefixes

### Turbo Suffixes

## eXtreme Mode

TypeWell’s eXtreme mode is a more advanced mode which fundamentally changes some aspects of the abbreviation system taught in training.  eXtreme mode should only be explored once mastery of the basic abbreviation system and Turbo mode is achieved.  It is important to note that unlike Turbo mode, captionists are not required to learn and use eXtreme mode.

eXtreme mode can be toggled on and off by hitting F3 on your keyboard, or by clicking Turbo →  eXtreme mode.  When eXtreme mode is on, it will say eXtreme mode (ON).

For additional practice resources and other helpful information about eXtreme mode, go to the Captionist Skill Building & Resources shell in myCourses and find the Skill Building section, where you can find a guide to eXtreme mode, additional resources for learning, and plenty of practice exercises.

## Math Mode

Math mode is used to render mathematical equations, expressions, and symbols.  Math mode training is offered by TypeWell as a courselet, with tutorials accessible by clicking Help → Math and Turbo Help.

Math mode is a useful tool, but it is important to always prioritize meaningful spoken content over mathematical equations. Especially in scenarios where equations are easily accessible on the board/PowerPoint slides, or when supported students are also receiving note-taking services.

There are multiple ways to use math mode.

Caps Lock key toggles in and out of math mode.

Ctrl + M toggles in and out of math mode.

Ctrl + Space after your keystrokes, instead of Space, will attempt to expand your abbreviation as if it were typed in math mode, without actually toggling math mode on.

See below for an overview of math mode:

Math mode temporarily changes the font to italicized Times New Roman for enhanced contrast.

If a lowercase letter is followed by a number, the number will be rendered as a superscript.

e.g. x2 → x2

If an uppercase letter is followed by a number, the number will be rendered as a subscript.

e.g. CO2 → CO2

Comma cycling will toggle the number between subscript, regular, and superscript.  Subscripts and superscripts can be strung together in a sequence.

e.g. x2y4 → x2y4, or C2H3O2 → C2H3O2

Ctrl + L creates superscripts (think “L” for low)

Ctrl + H creates superscripts with (think “H” for high).

Ctrl + N goes back to normal (think “N” for normal).

If you attempt to type multiple “nested” subscripts or superscripts, like a subscript of a subscript, this will NOT render properly for the TypeWell reader, even though it renders properly in your TypeWell transcriber window.

Greek symbols can be quickly rendered with Ctrl + Space, e.g. d {Ctrl + Space} → δ, f {Ctrl + Space} → φ.

Pressing Ctrl + Space repeatedly will toggle between lowercase and uppercase for Greek symbols, e.g. φ {Ctrl + Space} → Φ.

## Linking Guide

To view these instructions with screenshots, please visit:  TypeWell Linking Guide

TypeWell Web linking is a feature which allows the real-time TypeWell transcript to be viewed on almost any type of reader device, including smartphones, iPads, and other Web-enabled devices.  All the reader needs is a standard web browser and a reliable internet connection.  This is our standard practice for providing captioning to supported students.

To use Web linking, you need to create or enable a Web linking channel in TypeWell.  Click the Link dropdown menu at the top of the TypeWell software, and then click the by Web option.  This will open the Web Linking Setup window.  You then can choose the Link to dropdown menu, and select either the West coast server or East coast server option. Click the Add Channel button next to the dropdown menu, and a channel will be generated for you to use.  You can then give the channel a custom name to easily reference.

Check the box underneath Enabled that corresponds with the channel you want to use. Click the OK button at the bottom right of the window.  Now, provided the Linking On button is clicked in the Linked (formerly Link) dropdown menu at the top of the TypeWell window, you are successfully Web linked.

At the bottom right of the TypeWell window, you should see either Web West or Web East depending on which server you connected to.  If you click this, TypeWell will give you a popup window containing the reader URL used to view the captions you type in your TypeWell software.  It also automatically copies the URL to easily share it.  This is the URL we will provide to supported students who use their own devices to read captions, and also the URL we enter into our iPads should the student prefer to use an RIT-provided device.

If multiple transcribers are connected to the same channel, or if a reader is connected to the current channel’s URL, it will show this next to Web West or Web East at the bottom right of the window.  Readers connected to the URL will be shown with an R accompanied by the number of readers present (R1, R2, etc).  If multiple transcribers are connected to the same channel, this will be shown with a T accompanied by the number of transcribers present (T2, T3, etc).

When two captionists are teaming or sharing a class together, there is an easy way to share the channel with each other.  Click the Link or Linked dropdown menu at the top of the TypeWell software, and then click the by Web option.  This will open the Web Linking Setup window.  If you already have a channel created, simply click one of the eight letter codes beneath the Channel column and it will automatically copy the teaming name of the selected channel, which will be represented in the following format: xxxxxxxx_xxxxxx

This is the code you will share to let other captionists connect to the same channel.  To connect to another captionist’s channel, you add this copied code where it says West coast server in the Web Linking Setup window.  After the code has been pasted, click Add Channel, and the channel should be created below.

Even more information can be found about TypeWell linking by clicking the Help dropdown menu at the top of the TypeWell software, and then clicking Linking.  This will navigate you to a webpage that has detailed explanations of all the linking configurations TypeWell provides, as well as screenshots demonstrating the process outlined above.

### Internal Linking

In situations where internet access is not readily available or there is an internet outage when you are captioning, Internal Linking can be extremely helpful.  Internal Linking works by turning the transcriber’s laptop into a Wi-Fi Access Point.  Other devices in the area can then connect to that Virtual Access Point and see the real-time transcript.

Internal linking establishes a connection between the TypeWell program and a special program running on the same computer, called the Internal Server.  The Internal Server program runs silently in the background on the transcriber’s computer, even when the TypeWell software is not running.  The important thing to note here is that unlike Web Linking, Internal Linking works without an internet connection, because the server resides on the transcriber’s machine.

Since the process for setting up Internal Linking is fairly extensive, it is best to refer to the following guide: Internal Linking Guide

#### Quick Steps to Turning on Internal Linking

In TypeWell, open the Link dropdown → select By Internal

Hotkeys: Alt + L, then I

Choose Use Internal server on this computer → click OK

# Captioning           Information

## General Class Protocol

You must use the designated TypeWell channel for your class that is noted in ASDS, even if students use department iPads

Aim to arrive ten minutes before the start of class. This allows time to set up equipment and acclimate to the classroom.

If you are a second or third hour captionist, switch 5 minutes before your scheduled start time.

Determine the best place to sit in the classroom. In general, sitting against a sidewall in the front of the room is best so that you can hear the professor and see the lecture slides. When possible, avoid setting up where you or the relief captionist will have to walk in front of the professor, board, or students during lecture.

You cannot disclose which students use captioning to the professor. If they need to know for group work purposes, the professor may ask the class for students using access services to email them privately and they can work together to keep all captioning students in the same group to ensure communication access.

The professor is the authority in the classroom. Be polite. Remember that you are a guest in the classroom, and you are representing our department. Keep conversations with professors professional.

Do not participate in class. Do not correct a professor if you feel they state incorrect information. However, if you are unsure about something that was said, ask for clarification.  Maintain your role as an access services provider.

Captionists should be as quiet as possible. Turn off any computer notification noises. Silence your cell phone. Do not carry on conversations with fellow captionists while the professor is lecturing.

Do not eat while on assignments.

Cell phones and personal devices should be silenced or off, put away, and are not be used while on assignment.

Be willing to stay a few minutes after class only if a captioning student has a question for the professor. You may tell the student you have another assignment and need to leave if it goes beyond a few minutes.

Save all class transcripts until the semester is over. If there is a problem with an uploaded file, you may be asked to upload it again to ASDS at a later date.

Transcripts from special requests are never to be shared. If someone requests a copy of the transcript from a Special Request assignment, refer them to your manager. Save all other Special Request transcripts for at least one month.

## FYIs - Class Information Emails

FYI emails are used in a variety of situations. Any changes to a class, such as room location, student or professor absences, class cancellations, room changes, field trips, or needing equipment while in class should all be reported through email to rtc fyi. Be sure to copy in any captionists the class is shared with.

If you have more than one student in a class and one of them does not show up, send the FYI email about the student who did not attend class.

Please make sure to include a proper subject title. For example, if you are having connection issues in a class, make sure you include that information in the subject line.

The format for these emails is as follows:

### Outlook Template for FYI Emails

In Outlook you are able to create templates or “quick parts” that can be easily inserted into a message. To create a template to be used whenever you need to send an FYI email about a class follow the steps below.

Create a new email and write out what you want to be used in your template. For FYI emails this will be three rows with Class, Student(s), Captionist(s). You can add your name next to Captionists.

Highlight all the text you want to add to your template. Go to Insert tab → Quick Parts → click the dropdown arrow to the right → Select Save Selection to Quick Part Gallery…

Name your template and press OK. Now your quick parts template is ready for use.

To use your quick parts template in an email, first compose a new message. Then go to Insert → Quick Parts → select dropdown arrow to the right → your template will automatically appear in the menu. Select it and it will be added into your email message.

## Different Class Coverages

### Solo Classes

All 50-minute classes are covered by a single captionist.  Many 75-minute classes are also covered by a single captionist, depending on the nature and difficulty of the assignment.

### Teamed Classes

For classes that are 75 minutes, there may be situations where two captionists are assigned to the class together. Both captionists are expected to be in the room together for the full duration of class and should decide how to make switches while captioning, following the switching procedure outlined below.

If you and your teamer are covering an assignment that is longer than 75 minutes, it might be beneficial to make switches more frequently, such as every 10, 15, 20, or 30 minutes.

Teamers should devise a plan ahead of time with regards to switching times, equipment use, and uploading transcripts. Captionists are teammates and should work together to support one another. Each captionist should edit when they are not live captioning. If desired, the captionist not actively typing may assist by searching for spelling or terminology on a web browser to show their teamer. Be sure to discuss this beforehand, to see what each other’s preferences are.

#### Teamer Request Protocol

To obtain a teamer for any classes where you may need assistance, you must submit a Teamer Request Form (linked below).  Your request will be reviewed and a formal assessment will be conducted.  This may be through an OBS recording of the class the requesting captionist submits, or an in-class assessment from a Team Lead.

A rubric split into several metrics will be used to conduct a qualitative evaluation which will determine if a teamer is ultimately appropriate for the class. All four Team Leads will independently evaluate each request.

The purpose of this form is to provide a formal and transparent process for teaming requests, ensure that students are getting the best possible support in difficult classes, make sure that teamers are being allocated where they are most needed, and collect data for the Teamed Classes Database that will be used during scheduling.

Teamer Request Form

### Shared Classes

Captionists generally share classes that are two or more hours. The first captionist sets up and types for the first hour, and the second captionist will come into the classroom to switch with them for the second hour. Follow the switching procedure below.

First-hour captionists should try to set up in a place where switching can be smooth and not disruptive. Have a chair available for the relieving captionist. Keep your coat and belongings within easy reach.

Second- and third-hour captionists should arrive 10 minutes before their scheduled time to type and be ready to take over captioning by 5 minutes before. They should enter the class quietly, with coat off, laptop out. Be mindful of the noise made while setting up equipment so as not to disrupt class. Follow the switching procedure below.

### Switching Procedure

When a captionist is ready to take over the session, they will type the following:

***Indicates Change in Captionist***

10:55 am                       (This will be time switched)

In your PAL, most captionists use the abbreviation icc or ICC for this phrase.

Discuss the switch with your partner beforehand.

Does your partner use a stand? How will you manage the stand? How many iPads will be set up? How will you signal to each other your readiness to switch?

After the switch, the first hour captionist should gather their things and exit the classroom as quietly as possible. Coats and equipment can be zipped or adjusted out in the hallway.

All captionists sharing a class should have agreed on a common TypeWell channel.  Turn off the channel link when you are finished captioning your hour. Remember to save your file before you take over and at the end of your session.

iPads:

For managing iPads, come up with a system that works for all of you.

Typically, iPads can be returned directly to the first-hour captionist’s office, or left charging in 1260 with a note attached designating the number of iPads (if more than one) and who they belong to.

If the first-hour captionist chooses to check out iPads from 1260 rather than use their personal iPads, they will note the iPad numbers as well as date and time the iPads were checked out on the iPad sign-out sheet.  The last-hour captionist will return iPads to 1260, attach charging cords, and note the date and time the iPads were returned on the iPad sign-out sheet.

Avoid:

iPads should never be removed from a supported student during class. If a class is shared for two or more hours, the iPad will be left in place for the student to use. When teaming a class, discuss with your teamer how you will manage iPads. Come up with a system that works for both of you.

Avoid rolling the equipment bag across the room during a lecture. Pick it up and carry it in and out of the room while class is in session to minimize distractions.

## Before the First Day of Class

Before the first day of class, there are a few mandatory steps you must take (indicated by *).  Additionally, some helpful actions you can take to better prepare yourself are listed below.

### Create TypeWell Channels for Each Class *

You must use a unique TypeWell channel for each class you are assigned.  Failure to do so allows students to access captioning in classes they are not enrolled in, creating potential confidentiality concerns, and can result in two captionists using a single link simultaneously.

If you are sharing a multiple hour class with other captionists, the captionist who is scheduled to caption first will be the one to create a channel, add the channel to ASDS, and email the channel to all other captionists in the class.

Note: If you are teaming a class, coordinate with your teamer to determine who is in charge of this step.

After each unique TypeWell channel is created, add it under Link in the Captioning Data section in ASDS. Detailed instructions on how to add a channel to ASDS can be found here.

### Send Introduction Emails *

Before the first day of classes, you are required to send an introduction email to professors and supported students for each of your classes.  These emails establish our first line of communication, explain captioning, provider reader URLs to students and allows us to learn student’s preferences.

If you are sharing a multiple hour class with other captionists, the captionist who is scheduled to caption first will be the one to send all introductory emails.  This avoids sending out duplicate emails or needing to coordinate with multiple people before sending emails.

If you are teaming a class, coordinate with your teamer to determine who will send emails.

#### Professors

Introductory emails to professors allow us to inform professors there will be captionists in their class.  Some professors have never had captioning before so it is a nice way to inform them of how it works.  It can also help ensure you are enrolled in the myCourses shell for each class. You can find the email template, with important notes, here: Professor Intro Email Template

#### Captioning Students

Introductory emails to supported students allows us to inform students they will be receiving captioning for a class, share TypeWell reader links, and learn student’s preferences.  These emails will ask for the student’s preferred name, pronouns, if they would like captioning for: group work, non-class related comments, or exam days. Enter any relevant data to the “Needs” part of the Captioning Data section in ASDS. If your student does not want captioning for exam days, email rtc fyi with all exam days and let them know that captioning will not be needed those days.

Note: If you have multiple students in a class and any of them require captioning on exam days then you do not need to send an email to rtc fyi .

If you are sending out an email to multiple students in one class, you must bcc all recipients.  This is an important step that maintains the confidentiality of each student. You must create your TypeWell channels before you send any emails, so you have the URL to include in your email.

You can find the email template, with important notes, here: Student Intro Email Template

### Check Room Numbers

In ASDS, verify the room numbers for each of the classes you’ve been assigned.  While ASDS can occasionally have an incorrect room number listed, the “Meeting Patterns'' box at the top right of the window is where you should check.

It is advisable to physically check out the rooms your classes will take place in to make sure you can locate the classroom and to be prepared for any challenges it may present.  Detailed building and floor plans can be found here: RIT Building and Floor Plans

### Check myCourses

You should be automatically enrolled in the myCourses shells for each of the classes you are assigned.  Check out the content that is posted for any information about the class.  You can use this resource to get acclimated with any vocabulary that may be used during the semester. At the beginning of the semester it is common for the professor to not have much content added yet.

If the syllabus is posted in the myCourses shell, you can also use this to verify the location of the classroom.  It is important to note that not all professors use myCourses.  Additionally, you can look up transcripts from previous years using the “Course Lookup” function found in ASDS, or use the Captionist Skill Building & Resources shell to find vocabulary lists for specific courses and colleges.

### Add Class Headers to PAL

To your PAL add the entry:

Abbreviation:	  Create an abbreviation system that works for you.

New Expansion:

Class Name

Professor Name

Course name

{date}

Ctrl + Enter (line break)

Ctrl + Enter (line break)

### Checklist - Before First Day of Class

Create unique TypeWell channels for each class you caption alone, or if you are the first hour for a multi-hour class.  (If you are teaming a class, coordinate with your teamer on this step.)

Add TypeWell channel to the Captioning Data section of each class in ASDS

Send TypeWell channel to any other captionists in the class

Send Introductory Email to professors

Send Introductory Email to supported students (bcc multiple recipients)

Attach unique URL for each class

Optional:

Visit rooms listed in ASDS before the first day of class

Check myCourses for course content

Add class headers to PAL

## ASDS Captioning Data

All captionists must complete the Captioning Data section in ASDS for each of their classes as a way to communicate the specifics of a class when they are absent from work or are placed in a different assignment. If sharing a class, coordinate with your teamer as to who will enter in the information.

For each of your classes, you are asked to input:

Channel: TypeWell channel or C4 link

iPads: Number of iPads needed for class

Needs: Specific student needs such as if they do or do not need captioning for group work or exams

Other:  Any other information you would like to share about the class, such as where you sit in the classroom

To edit the Captioning Data in ASDS, click Edit to access the Edit Captioning Data popup screen. Detailed instructions with screenshots can be found in the Captioning Data Section of ASDS section.

# Captioning           FAQ

## FAQ | How to caption…

### How to caption… when filling in for a class

When you are assigned to cover a new class, it is your responsibility to check ASDS for class details.  Make sure to check how many supported students there are, how many iPads to bring to class, and what TypeWell channel you need to use. If you are filling in as a teamer or for a multiple hour class, reach out to any other captionists with any questions.

Note: If there is no information about the class in the ASDS Captioning Data section by the third week of the semester, please notify your Team Lead.

### How to caption… videos in class

RIT policy requires that all media shown in credit-bearing courses must be captioned. More details on captioning guidelines and resources on how to get media captioned can be found on RIT’s Teaching and Learning Services website.

General Guidelines

If a video/clip/movie is uncaptioned, do your best to caption it. If there is an online transcript/script available, provide that link. If appropriate, share the Teaching and Learning Services website with the professor, and/or have a private conversation with them after class and encourage them to utilize captioning per requirements of the ADA. If a professor continues to show uncaptioned materials, it is up to the student to address this with the professor.

If a video/clip/movie is captioned, take summarized notes, even if the student says it is not necessary. There may be tutors and other students who need those notes. If an online transcript is available, provide that link as well. If you have access to the video link, add that to the transcript.

If a major motion film is shown with captions and there is an online transcript/script available, provide that link and you do not need to take notes or provide a summary. If no online transcript/script is available and the student is being tested on the film, take summarized notes.

Indicate the start and end of the video in brackets.  You can include the title of the video/clip/movie if possible.

[Video.] or [Video - Introduction to the Human Brain]

[End of video.]

### How to caption… presentations

General Guidelines

Indicate the beginning and end of each presentation with brackets

[Presentation.]

[End presentation.]

Use the speaker’s name(s) when possible for any guest speakers

Vanessa:

Dr. Munson:

Do not retype the information that is already on a PowerPoint slide. Just indicate they are reading from the slide. E.g.|  [Reading from slide.] or [Reading slide.]

Note: It would be helpful to add these as briefs in your PAL. It is common to use the slash method or capitalization method. For instance: RS or /rs for [Reading from slide.]

### How to caption… in-class exams

Every exam and student need is different, so captioning support must be handled on a case-by-case basis. When an exam is scheduled, you should plan to cover it unless of the the following conditions is met:

All students in the class notify you they do not need captioning support for exams

All students are taking the exam in the testing center through DSO

If a student tells you they do not need captioning support for an exam, and you are not assigned to support anyone else in that class, you do not need to attend the class.

Send an email to rtc fyi to report that you are not needed for the exam.

You must inform rtc fyi at least 24 hours in advance when captioning is not needed for an exam.

For teamed classes, only one captionist will need to cover the exam. Send an email to rtc fyi and CC all assigned captionists as soon as you are aware of a scheduled exam. Teamers can alternate who covers exams throughout the semester. The captionist not covering the exam will be put on call.

Some students may take exams at the Test Center in the Disability Services Office (DSO). If a student is absent on exam day, they might be in the Test Center or they may have missed the test. Wait the usual amount of time, and then leave the class and email rtc fyi .

While supporting an in-class exam, remain attentive for instructions or corrections. Keep the TypeWell screen open in case captioning is needed.

If the exam follows a lecture, always start a new captioning page [File → New/Close] for the exam portion of class. Lecture information should not be available to the student while taking their exam. Be sure to save your current file before opening the new file.

Upload the transcript even if it only consists of [Exam.] and the class header.

### How to caption… when Wi-Fi isn’t working

If your iPad or laptop is failing to connect to the internet, the fix is often as simple as turning WiFi off and on again, or switching between the RIT-WiFi and eduroam networks.  If your devices are still failing to connect, there might be a university-wide outage, in which case you will need to rely on internal linking.

### How to caption… on the big screen (projecting captions)

There are some special request assignments, primarily at LBJ (building 60) or SDC (building 55), that require projecting your captions onto a larger screen for the whole audience to view.  HDMI and VGA dongles are available in HLC-1260 that will allow you to connect your iPad to the projector in the room.  Like the iPads, you have to sign out/in these dongles so they can be accounted for.

There will typically be a tech specialist in the room who can assist with setup.  However, it is possible that projection of captions is ultimately unsuccessful, either due to missing or incompatible cables/dongles.  Therefore, it is highly recommended to bring numerous extra iPads to these assignments to distribute to audience members who rely on captioning in the event of unsuccessful screen projection.  Alternatively, you may have to provide the TypeWell reader URL to the audience as a workaround.

If you need assistance with projecting to a larger screen or using dongles, reach out to a Specialist for help.

## FAQ | When a student…

### When a student… doesn’t show up to class

You can leave after waiting the appropriate amount of time:

50 minute, 75 minute, 2 hour classes: wait 15 minutes before leaving.

Classes that are 3 hours or longer: wait 30 minutes before leaving.

Send an email to rtc fyi to report any student absences. Copy in any captioning teammates as well, following the format in FYIs - Class Info Emails

Let rtc fyi know if you notice that any of your captioning students are frequently absent.

### When a student… is going to be absent

Let rtc fyi know if any student informs you they will be absent from class on a particular day. If they email you, forward the email along with course name and course number and include what days they will be absent.

### When a student… asks for captioning but hasn’t made a request

If a student requests an iPad or URL for class but has not submitted an official captioning request, you can give them an iPad but tell them they must submit a formal request through myAccess. If you notice they did not put in a captioning request but ask for an iPad again, let rtc fyi know. FYI will forward the message to the appropriate class coordinator who can reach out to students in the class.

### When a student… uses interpreting but asks for an iPad

If an interpreting student asks for an iPad, you can let them use one but need to explain that if any captioning student does not come to class you can’t stay and must leave. There are times when freelance interpreters are used for classes and coverage is not consistent. If you give an iPad to an interpreting student, make sure to update the Captioning Data section in ASDS to indicate the amount of iPads needed, in total. Be sure to also add a note under “Other” explaining the situation.

### When a student… doesn’t seem to need captioning

If you believe that captioning may not be needed for your class, contact rtc fyi. FYI can forward the information to the class/college coordinator who can reach out to students in the class and check on their captioning needs. Let FYI know the course number, name, and students you think don’t need captioning.

Reasons might include: student is not logging in as a reader/using the iPad, class is extremely group work based and the student does not require captioning for group work., there are multiple hours of a class but captioning is not used in all of them (captioning can be removed from the hours where it’s not needed).

### When a student… doesn’t take an iPad/connect as a reader but there are other students in the class

If a class has multiple students but you notice that not everyone takes an iPad or logs on as a reader, email rtc fyi the course number, course name, name of students you think are not using captioning (if you know). FYI can forward the message to the class/college coordinator who will reach out to students in the class to check on their captioning needs. If this happens only occasionally you don’t need to let FYI know.

### When a student… asks how to get a notetaker

If a student would like a notetaker in their class, direct them to submit a request through myaccess.rit.edu for their course.

### When a student… asks how to get extra time on an exam or any other accommodation

If a student would like help getting extra time on their exams, quizzes, etc or needs help with any other accommodations, direct them to the DSO office and their my DSO portal: MyDSO Portal | Disability Services Office | RIT

### When a student… disconnects as a reader during class

If a student is using their own device to view captions and they disconnect as a reader for 15 minutes or longer, you may treat it as a student no-show. Email rtc fyi and include any other captionists if it’s a multiple hour class. The only time this does not apply is on the first day of classes.

### When a student… doesn’t take an iPad or connect as a reader on the first day of classes

If a student is still listed as a captioning user in ASDS and doesn’t take an iPad or connect as a reader on their own device, send them an email 5 minutes into class to remind them of the TypeWell link and that you are there with iPads. If they do not respond and do not take an iPad or connect as a reader on their own device after 20 minutes, you may leave the class and send an email to rtc fyi to let them know.

### When a student… didn’t indicate their group work preferences and there’s group work in class

If a student did not let you know their preference for group work before the semester starts, you can send a message in TypeWell, as a captionist, and ask if they would like captioning for any group work. You can also let them know they can send you a message back or wave you over if they decide they would like it captioned.

If the student moves for group work and brings the iPad with them, you can default to assuming they want group work captioned and follow the student to their spot. They can let you know then what they would like covered. Some students take an iPad for group work but only want the captionist to caption when the professor talks to the entire class.

When you know a student’s preference, make sure to update the Captioning Data section in ASDS to indicate the student’s needs. If there are multiple students in the class, make sure to specify which student the needs are for.

### When a student… needs captioning for group work but there are multiple students in the class

If a class has multiple students but only one requires captioning for group work, follow the student that would like captioning and caption everything their group says, in addition to the professor. Make sure to indicate this in the Captioning Data section in ASDS and explain which student to caption for. If you feel what was talked about was sensitive or that the group members did not want other people in the class to know, you can delete the group work section from the transcript before uploading it to ASDS.

If a class has multiple students that would all like group work captioned, you can let the students know if they would like captioning they will need to be in the same group. It is up to the students to advocate for themselves and ask the professor to switch their groups if needed. Alternatively, if you know ahead of time this situation will occur, you can ask the professor to send an email to the class asking anyone who would like captioning for group work to email them, so they can break up groups accordingly. It is up to the students to self-disclose, you can’t tell the professor which students need to be together.

### When a student… asks you to voice for them

If a student asks you to voice for them in class, coordinate with them on how they would like that to work. It’s important that you say the message exactly as the student has written it. Do not reword the message, speak in the third person, or say “they said…”, you are speaking as the student.

Sometimes people will ask you follow-up questions or speak directly to you, instead of the student after you voice. In these cases, caption what is said, and look at the student. If anyone is confused you can explain you are just voicing for the student, they are who is speaking.

If you know before class starts the student would like you to voice it would be helpful to explain this to the professor so they know what to expect.

The general protocol is:

The student will send you a message in TypeWell as a reader with what they would like to say

The student raises their hand

When the student is called on, you will voice what their message says. Be sure to first say “This is…” followed by the students name, so the class knows they are who is speaking. Make sure to voice exactly what their message says, do not reword it or talk in the third person.

### When a student… takes exams in the testing center

If a student tells you they take exams in the testing center, send an email to rtc fyi letting them know the course number, course name, and student who goes to the testing center for classes. FYI will add a note in ASDS. Whenever there is an exam let FYI know at least 24 hours in advance.

### When a student… doesn’t need captioning for exams

If a student tells you they don’t need captioning for exams, send an email to rtc fyi letting them know the course number, course name, and student(s) that don’t need captioning for exams. FYI will add a note in ASDS. Whenever there is an exam let FYI know at least 24 hours in advance.

### When a student… doesn’t need captioning for exams but a different captioning student in the class does

If a student tells you they don’t need captioning for exams/takes exams in the testing center, but a different captioning student wants exam coverage, you should still send an email to rtc fyi letting them know the course number, course name, and student(s) that don’t need captioning for exams, however you will still attend class as usual on exam days and caption for the other students. You do not need to inform FYI of any exam days if you are going to stay to caption during it.

## FAQ | When a class…

### When a class… course schedule changes

Email rtc fyi of any changes in course schedules, including class cancellations, classroom location changes, field trips, in meeting times, class number changes, or if a professor will be switching to Zoom format for any classes.

### When a class… location changes

Email rtc fyi of any changes in classroom location due to room changes, field trips, a professor will be switching to Zoom for a class, etc. Include the course name, course number, students, captionists. Even if this change is only for one day, it is important ASDS reflects the correct location, since you may be out unexpectedly and the person filling in would not know the location changed.

### When a class… is not listed in your myCourses

At the beginning of each semester captionists are added to the myCourses shells for classes they are assigned to caption in. If after the first day of class you are still not in myCourses, reach out to the professor of the course and ask them to manually add you. If they need assistance adding you to myCourses, direct them to your manager.

### When a class… has a fire alarm or emergency alert go off

Never jeopardize your safety if you are in a classroom and an alarm goes off. If possible, place your laptops and iPads in your backpack or bag and leave via the closest exit. If unable, leave all equipment in the room and exit the building. Wait for the building “all-clear” before returning to get your equipment and/or finish captioning the class.

### When a class… needs a teamer

To request a teamer for any class, submit a Teamer Request Form. Once received, the request is reviewed and assessed by all Team Leads. This evaluation may involve an OBS audio recording submitted by the captionist or a Team Lead attending class alongside the captionist to team and record in person.

Each request is evaluated using a multi-metric rubric to determine if a teamer is appropriate. In cases where no teamer is available or the class doesn’t meet the threshold for a teamer, your Team Lead will work with you on strategies to help manage the class.

This process provides a formal and transparent way to request a teamer, ensures students receive the best possible support in challenging classes, allocates teamers where they are most needed, and collects data for the Teamed Classes Database, which helps with future scheduling.

Classes approved for teaming are added to the Teamed Classes Database, so if you later submit a request and the class/professor is already in the database, a teamer is automatically approved and no new evaluation is required. While the department makes every effort to cover database listed classes automatically, scheduling constraints or captionist preferences may still require solo coverage at times. In all cases the Teamer Request Form must still be submitted.

### When a class… needs temporary coverage

There are times when a class may need additional hours covered that usually don’t have captioning, such as critiques. If this happens, email rtc fyi the course number, name, students, dates & times needing additional coverage.

### When a class… doesn’t need all hours covered

There are times when a multi-hour class doesn’t need all hours covered but there are captionists assigned to all hours. Reasons can include the professor saying class will only be in the first hour, other hours are for work time/group work and the student doesn’t need captioning for it, etc. If this happens, let rtc fyi  know the course number, name, students, and what hours do not need to be covered.

### When a class… ends early/doesn’t need other hours that day

There are times when a class that has multiple hours ends early. If you are the first hour in the class and they end early, or the professor says class will end early, email rtc fyi as soon as possible. Tell  rtc fyi the course number, name, students, all captionists, and CC any other captionists that cover the class. FYI can place other captionists on-call and they can help cover classes that need coverage at that time.

## FAQ | When a professor…

### When a professor… doesn’t show up to class

If a professor doesn’t show up to class you can first check your emails and myCourses to see if they sent a message. If they indicated that class was cancelled, send a message to the students in TypeWell letting them know, and send an email to rtc fyi before leaving the room.

If there is no email or announcement from the professor, you can wait 20 minutes or until the captioning students leave, and send an email to rtc fyi letting them know what happened.

### When a professor… asks how to access class transcripts or use myaccess.rit.edu

Professors can access transcripts and notes through myaccess.rit.edu by signing in with their RIT credentials. Their courses will appear under a tab, and after expanding this tab view, their classes will appear. From there they can view any notes or transcripts available for courses they have taught in which captioning or notetaking was provided.

They must select the correct semester to view transcripts and notes. Any classes where captioning or notetaking was provided should continue to appear in their view. If assistance is needed, direct them to email your manager with any questions or concerns.

### When a professor… wants to opt out of class recordings

If a professor would like to opt out of class recordings, add their information here: Professor Class Recording Opt-Out List. Instructions for adding a name to this list can be found in the sheet.

### When a professor… asks who the captioning students are

Share that while you cannot disclose which students use captioning, the professor can ask the class for students using access services to email them privately and self-disclose. You can tell the professor the number of students using captioning only.

If the professor is asking because they are worried about captioning for groupwork, they can send an email and ask the class for students using access services to email them privately so they can work together to keep all captioning students in the same group to ensure communication access. Some students may not need captioning for group work and they can inform the professor at that time.

### When a professor… asks how to caption videos/asks you to caption videos

If a professor asks you to caption the videos they show in class or how to get their videos captioned, direct them to the Teaching and Learning Services website. This information was given in the professor intro emails so you can also let them know there is more information in your original introduction email.

RIT policy requires that all media shown in credit-bearing courses must be captioned. More details on captioning guidelines and resources on how to get media captioned can be found on RIT’s Teaching and Learning Services website.

### When a professor… asks you to sign an NDA for their class

If a professor asks you to sign an NDA due to the sensitive nature of their class, do not take any action until talking to your manager. Tell the professor you need to talk to your manager and will get back to them about the next steps. As soon as the professor asks you this, reach out to your manager and they will tell you what to do next.

## FAQ | When a captionist…

### When a captionist … has a personal emergency during class

If you have a medical/personal emergency during an assignment, do your best not to disrupt class. If you are ill, type a message to your student and leave the classroom. If you are teaming, let your teamer know and leave the classroom. If there is an interpreter nearby, explain that you are ill and need to leave. If you feel you are unable to return to class, you can ask that person to contact our office if they are able.

If you are ill and need to permanently leave the class, send a chat to your student saying you need to leave. If you are able, pack up, collect the iPad(s), and quietly leave. When you are able, email/call your manager and notify rtc fyi or call the RTC administrative coordinator.  If you are unable to pack up, leave the classroom and notify the office. Someone will be sent to replace you or to pick up your equipment.

### When a captionist … has other needs arise

If you need equipment, your teammate does not show, you can’t find the classroom, class is not where it should be, etc., send an urgent email to rtc fyi or call the RTC Administrative Coordinator.

### When a captionist … is listed as the notetaker

If the notetaker is listed as Captionist A it means any transcript uploaded by the captionist is acting as the notes for the class. If your captioning student does not come to class, the captionist does NOT stay to caption or take notes. If the notetaking student is not a captioning student, they will miss notes for that day. If this becomes an issue for a notetaking student, the notetaking coordinator can potentially assign a student notetaker instead.

At any point of a student that requested notetaking would like a student notetaker instead of using the transcript as notes, direct them to the notetaking coordinators.

## FAQ | First day of class

### First day of class… introduction to students

On the first day of class, when a student grabs an iPad from you, you can introduce yourself as the captionist.  If they have not already indicated their preferences by responding to your introduction email, it is a good idea to ask about their communication preferences for classroom side comments and group work. You can wait to ask this until group work comes up. See other FAQ sections for more details.

### First day of class… introduction to professor(s)

On the first day of class, you can introduce yourself to the professor either before class starts or after class. Professors should have received an intro email prior to this class period so you can tell them to refer to the email with any questions related to captioning. Please see other FAQ sections for more questions related to professors.

### First day of class… introduction to interpreters

On the first day of class, you can introduce yourself to any interpreters in the class. Let them know you need a chair and where you need to sit and work out a seat arrangement that works for both of you. Let them know if any other captionists will be coming in to switch with you and if you need a chair for them.

### First day of class… introduction to notetakers

Notetakers are instructed to introduce themselves to the professor, interpreters, and captionists so they may introduce themselves to you. You can view their name in ASDS. If Captionist A is listed as a notetaker then captioning transcripts are used as notes and there is not another student assigned to take notes. You do not need to do anything different if you see this.

## FAQ | Intro emails

### Who sends intro emails when a class is teamed?

Reach out to your teamer and discuss who will send both professor and student emails. You can choose to split up the class so one teamer emails the students and the other emails the professor or have one captionist email both.

### Who sends intro emails when a class is multiple hours long?

When a class has multiple hours, by default the captionist covering the first hour should send all emails for this course, including student and professor emails. Make sure to cc any other captionists in the class, and make sure everyone knows you sent the emails. Since this person is sending all emails, they will also need to create the channels for class, and add that information to ASDS so the rest of the captionists can access it.

### How do you send student intro emails when there is more than one student in the class?

If you are sending out an email to multiple students in one class, you must bcc all recipients.  This is an important step that maintains the confidentiality of each student.  You do not need to include a “to”, you can have all recipients as “bcc”.

# Class & SR          Transcripts

## Saving Transcripts

To save a transcript in TypeWell, press Ctrl + S or go to File → Save to, then choose where you would like to save your transcript, and enter the name, following the convention below.  It is helpful to save your transcript as soon as you are in class and have the heading typed out.  This allows you to easily view the course name/date and lets you quickly save your work at the end of class.  After this initial save, you can press Ctrl + S at the end of class and your transcript will automatically be saved in the correct spot.

When saving, use the naming convention: date (month, day, last two digits of year), followed by a dash, and the course number (leaving out any dashes between course name and number).

For example: BIOL-101-01 on 03/13/24 would be saved as 031324-BIOL10101

If there are multiple hours of a class, or if a class is teamed, each hour will save the transcript with their initials, in lowercase, before the date.

E.g. am031324-BIOL10101.

The person who uploads the final transcript will remove their initials after all hours are combined.

It is important to keep all your class transcripts organized.  An easy way to do this is by creating folders on your desktop, with a name corresponding to each individual class.

To add a new folder to your desktop: Right Click (anywhere on the screen) → New → Folder. Create new folders each semester; at the end of finals week you can delete your folders or move them to an archived folder. This keeps your desktop from being cluttered and makes finding transcripts to upload much easier.

When files are saved from TypeWell, they are automatically in Rich Text File (.rtf) format. After your transcript is edited, you must change the file type to Word Document (.docx) format. To do this, go to File → Save As, and from the bottom dropdown menu, where you see Rich Text File, select Word Document instead.  If you do not change the document type from Rich Text File (.rtf) you will not be able to upload your transcript to ASDS. After your transcript is in .docx format you can delete the .rtf version from your desktop.

## SR (Special Request) Transcripts

SR transcripts should be saved for one month but are never to be shared with others, unless directed to do so by a Manager. Questions regarding SR transcripts should be forwarded to a Manager.

## Editing Class Transcripts

After each class, use the following checklist to format and edit your transcript. This establishes a uniform appearance for all transcripts. For a quick reference to this checklist, bookmark: Transcript Editing Checklist.

When a class is shared, the first hour person will edit their transcript, save with their initials before the date, and send it to the next hour captionist. The second hour captionist will edit their transcript and then copy and paste it below the first hour’s transcript.  This combined transcript will be sent to the third hour captionist, where they will follow the same procedure.  The last hour captionist will then upload the final combined transcript, removing any initials before uploading to ASDS. If a class is teamed, captionists should discuss who will merge and upload the final transcript.

Editing and sending your transcript to other captionists in the class should be done as soon as possible, usually within 1-2 hours.  If there will be a long delay in sending your transcript to the next hour's captionist, talk to the captionist expecting your part.

Note: Do not keep in Rich Text File .rtf or you will be unable to upload your transcript to ASDS.

Delete .rtf version

## Uploading Class Transcripts

Class transcripts should be edited and uploaded to ASDS as soon as possible. Our department policy states that transcripts should be made available within 24 hours. If there is an issue or reason for delay, please contact your manager.

If a class is teamed, captionists should discuss who will merge and upload the transcript. If there is a multiple hour class, the last hour will upload the entire transcript, after all hours are merged together into one document. Remove any initial from the document name before uploading it to ASDS.

For a guide on how to upload your transcripts in ASDS, go to the Transcripts in ASDS section.

# Career          Ladder

The Captionist Career Ladder Promotion process is offered annually usually during spring semester. The dates of the process vary each year, but the managers will send out an email with the deadlines and other necessary information at some point in the spring semester.

With manager support, captionists who meet the criteria of being promoted may complete a letter of intent to be considered for this process. The promotion process consists of evaluation in both captioning skill and professional comportment. Upon completion, a captionist can move from Level I to Level II, or Level II to Level III. All captionists must be promoted to a Level II as per stated deadlines.  Components of the promotion process are outlined below.

## Captionist Promotion Process

Gain manager’s approval to begin the process.

Record two (2) work samples.

Fill out and submit the Captionist Letter of Intent to your manager.

Take the Point-in-Time Test.

## Work Sample Submissions

The captionist will provide the managers with two (2) recorded (OBS) work submissions which showcase and highlight their best work. Each captionist should meet with their manager and Team Lead to discuss which type of work samples they should work on recording prior to submission. Lecture type classes work best. It is best to submit the entire recording and not try to pare down the audio file. Captionists may request feedback and advice on their work samples from their Team Lead.

The captionist will create a Google drive folder labeled “CL Promotion 2024 [your last name here]” e.g.

“CL Promotion 2024 Smith”. The captionist will upload their work samples to this folder. The Google folder must be shared with both managers. The managers will access and score one or both files during the promotion process.

## Captionist Letter of Intent

Once you have recorded your work samples, fill out the Captionist Letter of Intent and submit it to your manager. The Letter of Intent is a form that confirms that you have already recorded and uploaded your work samples onto Google Drive and shared them with both managers. In this form, you will indicate what level you are requesting to be promoted from, provide the file names/links of the work samples in this form, and sign and date it. This form should be returned to your manager by the specified deadline.

## Point-in-Time Test

Your manager will reach out to you to let you know when you are able to complete the Point-in-Time test. This is a 20-minute long audio that is embedded within the TypeWell software. The captionist will sign into their laptop and the TypeWell software to access this assessment. Directions will be provided at that time.

The captionist will read and acknowledge the confidentiality disclaimer. An informational paragraph containing terminology and subject matter about the audio will be provided and a brief period of time will be allotted for prep. A warm-up audio will precede the point-in-time test and immediately after this warm-up the captionist will begin the point-in-time test.

Once the point-in-time test is completed, the transcript file will be automatically uploaded from the software and sent to TypeWell. The assessment will then no longer be accessible.

TypeWell will securely receive the transcript file. It will be saved with an unidentifiable naming convention. When all captionists have completed the promotion process, the unidentifiable files will be sent to the RTC/NT managers with no distinguishable information included.

The managers will independently score each transcript, so that each file will be double-blind scored.

## Scoring Rubric

The managers will use the following rubric to score the point-in-time test as well as submitted work samples:

Your final career ladder score is computed by weighting your scores in each domain and summing them up:

# PDs &           Downtime

## PDs

When classes are not in session, PDs or Professional Developments are held to foster continual skill improvement and promote departmental connections. The RTC/NT Specialists are responsible for developing and implementing PDs during breaks. Anyone may hold their own PD in collaboration with the Specialists. To suggest a PD idea, whether for yourself or for someone else, please contact the Specialists.

### PD Expectations

When you do not have any assignments or SRs on your schedule, it is expected that you attend all PDs offered.  Please sign up ahead of time via the Google Doc sent out each semester by the Specialists.  You must also sign in to every PD via the sign-in sheet and log it in your talent roadmap after attending.  For any help with this please reach out to the Specialists.

## Downtime

There may be times when you don’t have a class coming up, your editing is done, and you have nothing immediately requiring your attention.

There are a number of effective ways to use this time:

Look ahead and prepare for upcoming classes.

Online textbooks are available at openstax.org/subjects if you need more background information.

Visit the Captionist Skill Building and Resources module on MyCourses.

Look through the department’s Quick Resource Guide for TypeWell tips.

Create skill building goals and practice.

Work on professional development ideas you have or workshops you would like to present.
